# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

This repository section gathers all core process documentation for how OctoAcme runs projects, so teammates can easily find guidance, standards, and templates for successful, repeatable delivery. The README summarizes our approach, then links to each major process area below.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme uses a transparent, iterative project management process built on these principles:

- **Customer-first, value-focused delivery**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative planning and continuous improvement**: Deliver small, testable increments and learn from each cycle
- **Clear roles and responsibilities**: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA/Testing, and Stakeholders work together with defined ownership
- **Risk identification and escalation**: Proactively identify and manage risks at every stage
- **Documentation and templates**: Support onboarding, execution, and retrospectives with clear, accessible documentation
- **Regular communication and knowledge sharing**: Maintain alignment through structured cadences and ad-hoc updates

Our project lifecycle follows five key phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each phase has defined artifacts, roles, and communication patterns to ensure transparency and successful delivery.
